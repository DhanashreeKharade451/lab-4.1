After completing this activity, take a few minutes to reflect on the following questions:

How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?

I focused on designing functions that could handle different inputs by using parameters instead of hardcoded values. This made the functions reusable in multiple scenarios. I also added input validation to ensure the functions could handle missing or incorrect values gracefully. By using optional parameters, such as the discount in the total cost calculation, I was able to extend the functionality without breaking existing code.

What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?

One of the main challenges was syntax because Previously I worked on python so I was used to with python syntax and that is why was checking syntax every time .secondly I was keep  forgoting semicolon because habit of not giving semicolon in python. deciding the correct order of conditions so that each scenario was handled properly. For example, in the eligibility function, it was important to check the age requirement first before determining employment status. in python I used elif so checked my some time to check js syntax in js Using clear if-else statements helped keep the conditions readable and easy to understand.

How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?

Refactoring improves readability by reducing repetition and making the code easier to follow. By organizing logic into reusable functions and using meaningful variable names, the code becomes more understandable for others and for future updates. Refactoring also improves maintainability because changes can be made in one place without affecting the entire codebase, reducing the risk of errors and making enhancements easier to implement.
